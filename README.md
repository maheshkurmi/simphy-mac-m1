# Simphy java app for Mac M1
After a huge amount of efforts and time, we are proud to announce that SimPHY now works natively on MacOS arm64.
However we could’t still create dmg installer, means Jva will have to be installed.

## Follow the steps to get it working

* install Java for M1: https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.52.13-ca-jre11.0.13-macosx_aarch64.dmg
* download this repository and extract 
* double click simphy.jar in app folder to run application
* if it does’t work, run command java -jar simphy.jar
* If still it does’t work, share the outcome of terminal
